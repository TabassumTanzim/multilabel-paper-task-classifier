# PaperCode_Scraping


Information has been extracted from [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota). Initially, the paper URLs were obtained, leading to the creation of a dataset containing paper titles and their respective links. Subsequently, by visiting each URL in the dataset, abstracts and associated tasks of the papers were extracted.

I intend to undertake a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project utilizing this [dataset](all_data.csv), which encompasses nearly 27,000 papers.
